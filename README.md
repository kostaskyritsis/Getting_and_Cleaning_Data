# Getting_and_Cleaning_Data

This repository contains the run_analysis.R script for the Assignment of the Coursera Getting and Cleaning data course.

It also contains the Codebook.md file with information about the script and each variable.

The run_analysis.R script uses the .txt files from the UCI HAR Dataset directory to:

1. Create data frames containing the test and train data

These data frames are then merged with rbind function to create one data set

2. Extracts the positions of the variables (columns), from the features.txt file, that contain the terms "mean" and "std"

The vectors containing these positions are used to subset the data frame and keep only the measurements (variables -> columns) on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement (rows)

3. The names of the activities are extracted from the activity_labels.txt file along with their ID numbers

The ID numbers are then used to replace correctly the numbers of the 2nd column (orinally coming from y_test.txt and y_train.txt files) with the names of the activities

4. The names of the variables (columns) are extracted from the feature.txt file and assigned to the variables of the data set, along with the names "Subject" and "Activity" for the first and second column, respectively

5. Finally the tidy_data_set is generated by using the functions %>%, group_by and summarise_each, from the dplyr package. The tidy_data_set contains the tidy data with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
